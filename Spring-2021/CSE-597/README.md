# CSE 597: Special Topic (Natural Language Processing)

## Course Description
This class in Natural Language Processing is aimed at graduate students in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, especially those who intend to pursue graduate level research in natural language processing, either as the main focus of their doctoral dissertation, or as a supporting area. Students will learn the state-of-the-art in computational approaches to human language, and a range of techniques that convert language data to computable representations at multiple levels of language analysis. Thus the topics covered will include fundamental techniques at the word level, such as part-of-speech tagging, and both distributional and symbolic representations of word meaning; at the sentence level, such as language modeling,
